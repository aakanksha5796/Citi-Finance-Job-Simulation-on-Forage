# Citi-Finance-Job-Simulation-on-Forage
This repository contains my work from the *Citi Finance Job Simulation* on Forage, completed in March 2025. This simulation provided hands-on experience in financial analysis, capital adequacy, and risk management within Citi's Finance team.

## Project Overview

As part of this job simulation, I completed key finance-related tasks, including:

- **Financial Performance Reporting:** Summarized movements in key performance indicators (KPIs) for senior management.
- **Regulatory Capital Analysis:** Reviewed minimum capital adequacy ratios for operating units and calculated the **risk-weighted asset (RWA)** value using the **Federal Reserve Board's (FRB) methodology**.
- **Macroeconomic Impact Assessment:** Analyzed the potential impact of the **Omicron variant on 2022 credit card sales**.
- **Financial Risk Reporting:** Created a **PowerPoint presentation** for the **Country Treasurer team and CFO**, summarizing key financial risk triggers.

## Key Learning Outcomes

This simulation strengthened my expertise in:

- **Financial Analysis & Reporting:** Understanding and summarizing key financial metrics for senior leadership.
- **Capital Adequacy & Risk Assessment:** Evaluating regulatory capital requirements and calculating RWAs.
- **Macroeconomic Research:** Assessing the impact of economic events on financial performance.
- **Presentation & Communication:** Effectively communicating financial risks to senior executives.
